            <div class="description">This is essentiually breaking a longer note into shorter notes. This is really simple in a DAW's piano roll. But still not too hard with western traditional notation. There a few different ways depending on what your needs / desires are.</div>
            <div class="steps">
                <ol>
                    <li>Cut the long note into shorter repeated notes</li>
                    <li>Move the little notes up or down, leave some in place, and in some cases remove some to make rests or syncopations.</li>
                    <li>Some common patterns depending on what note follows this original note - but in all cases the first note of the diminution is the same pitch as the original note.
